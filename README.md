# Zippy

Description:An opinionated starter template that uses: Angular + TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The zippy will have these following sample pages:

(A) a dashboard 'Home' with header, footer, and side panels
(B) a 'Sign In' page that is not hooked up to auth (when you click sign in, it checks a hard-coded username & password)
(C) an 'About' page that talks about the starter, e.g. the technologies in use and a link to the GitHub README to get started.
